## How to install:
To install, you need to go to your Photoshop file and replace "UIColors.txt"

MAKE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP! I AM NOT RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES!

But..If you forget to make a backup, just use "UIColors.txt.backup" and remove the ".backup"

## Windows:
1. go to "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2023\Required"
2. rename "UIColors.txt to "UIColors.txt.backup"
3. move the "renderer.css" file from this github to "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2023\Required"

## Linux:
1. Same procedure, just find your photoshop folder

## MacOS:
1. Same procedure, just find your photoshop folder


For the best colors, set the color them in "edit > prefrences > interface" to the darkest

The UI color theme only applies to open files and not the home page. If you can find out how to change the home page please let me know aty the email above.
